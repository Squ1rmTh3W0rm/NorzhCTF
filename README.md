NorzhCTF was my first ever CTF event! There was some technical troubles on the event coordinators end when the event first started.
However, I really enjoyed how the event was setup and the difficulty of the challenges. I would like to thank everyone at [ENSIBS](https://twitter.com/ENSIBS) who helped put this on! Even though my team was nowhere close to winning we had fun and learned lots along the way!
