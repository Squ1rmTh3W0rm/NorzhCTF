# S1de Ch4nnel: 20
## A Norzh-Flight developer is using a weak password did some experimentation on his workstation to secretly handle the flag. Will you be able to retrieve this one? You can connect to this workstation using SSH on port 2222 with the user norzh, password norzhctf2021. Retrieve the flag.txt

My team was not able to capture the flag. Please see the linked write-up.
